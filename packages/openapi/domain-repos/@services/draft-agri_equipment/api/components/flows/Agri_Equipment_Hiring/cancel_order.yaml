summary: Agricultural Equipment Hiring (Buyer cancels the placed Order)
description: >-
 The following is an illustrative flow for performing a transaction where a buyer wants to hire agricultural equipment. The booking process primarily occurs in four phases: discovery of available services and service providers based on serviceability, order, fulfillment, and post-fulfillment. If the buyer wants to cancel a confirmed order, the buyer is shown the cancellation terms. The seller's terms and conditions, which were displayed at the time of booking, must be followed. If the order is prepaid, the refund or partial payment should be processed by the buyer app, and cancellation details should be communicated to the seller/driver. The buyer app may also collect feedback and cancellation reasons.
