# PRD: Agriculture Services

Our efforts are focused on “Soil Testing as a service” and “Assaying as a service” in the MVP phase since
Digital adoption in the agri space has been a key challenge in the country and as per anecdotal evidence it is understood that the adoption of the smaller services will be faster compared to some of the other use cases like selling of agri produce (output)

Once the trust through purchase and fulfilment of services with less monetary value associated are built & delivered on the ONDC network we can move on to enabling use cases with higher monetary value use cases like sell & purchase of agri output.
We have seller apps supporting soil testing and assaying use cases as of now supporting soil testing and assaying services.

#### Now let’s understand the overall soil testing ecosystem in India

Below are various dominant groups of soils found in India, categorised by soil taxonomy and chemical properties:

- Red Soil: These soils are extensive in their distribution and derive their red colour from the diffusion of iron throughout the profile.
- Lateritic Soil: Comprising a blend of hydrated oxides of aluminium and iron along with minor amounts of manganese oxide.
- Black Soil: Characterised by a high proportion of calcium and magnesium carbonates, exhibiting a high degree of fertility.
- Alluvial Soil: Representing the largest and agriculturally most significant group of soils.
- Desert Soil: Predominantly found in arid regions, rich in quartz content.
- Forest and Hill Soils: Abundant in organic matter.

Why is Soil testing required? → Short answer is to improve the “Soil fertility”.
How do you define soil fertility: It is the capacity of a soil to supply plant nutrients in adequate amounts to facilitate optimum growth and obtaining the yield potential of a crop.
Many soil properties which determine the availability of plant nutrients and thus soil fertility are as follows:

- Soil pH
- Soil acidity
- Salinity and alkalinity
- Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) : The power to retain cations at the surface of soil colloids is referred to as the cation exchange capacity
- Soil organic matter (SOM)
- Nitrogen cycle
  -- Nitrogen fixation
  -- Conversion of N in soil
  -- Mineralization

### PLANT NUTRIENTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS

Numerous elements play crucial roles in the growth and development of plants, with those acquired from the soil generally termed as plant nutrients. Additionally, plants absorb carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen from the air or water via their roots. Altogether, 16 elements have been identified as essential for plant growth.

##### Major nutrients:

- Group I : Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.
- Group II: Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium

##### Secondary Nutrients:

Calcium, magnesium, sulphur

##### Micro nutrients:

Iron, manganese, boron, zinc, copper, molybdenum and chlorine.

#### What is Soil Testing and why is it important?

Soil testing refers to the chemical analysis of soils and is well recognized as a scientific means for quick characterization of the fertility status of soils and predicting the nutrient requirement of crops.

One of the objectives of soil tests is to sort out the nutrient deficient areas from non-deficient ones.

Once the soil deficiency is identified, farmers can use the accurate fertiliser for crop nutrition ensuring that the crop yield is optimal. However, apart from correct crop nutrition, soil testing also ensures that farmers are not using a nutrient for which the soil is not deficient.

#### Challenges in the Soil Testing/Assaying services space in India

1. Through the years, mis-selection and unbalanced application of chemical inputs has resulted into degraded soil and increased dependency on chemical inputs.
2. It is difficult for farmers to make informed decisions for selecting the right type and quantity of inputs as per their soil health.
3. The current infrastructure of 3000 soils testing laboratories across the country is not sufficient to address the need of 9 Crore farmers, also these laboratories take considerable amounts of time at least 10-14 days to deliver the soil advisory.
   setting up soil testing laboratories is also expensive, as current soil testing technologies require infrastructure, electricity, and skilled personnel hence difficult to scale.
4. Lack of Awareness: Many farmers are not aware of the importance of soil testing and its benefits in optimising crop yields. There's a need for extensive awareness campaigns to educate farmers about the significance of soil testing.
5. Indian farmers rely majorly on the local ecosystem of services/labs enabled by government organisations.

Due to these issues, soil testing is often neglected, and the unregulated use of fertilisers has become rampant and serious.

#### Unbundling the Agriculture ecosystem and making it interoperable

ONDC facilitates the modularization of the ecosystem, allowing sellers to focus on their specialisation and improve their offerings. This will lead to more innovation and better-tailored offerings across the entire value chain. It also enables every seller of any service to enhance their offerings while the buyer application focuses on onboarding customers such as farmers, traders, government entities, FPOs, and corporations. This open approach fosters collaboration and innovation.

ONDC is working on enabling 360 degree solutions around farmers (farming) so that they can

- procure any good and service relevant to pre/post harvest value chain and
- sell their produce through multiple channels to all prospective buyers

Farmers will be able to interact with technology/e-commerce networks through multiple channels such as Mobile/Web Application/Assisted Commerce etc.

These applications will provide following interfaces to farmers

- B2F Buyer Application - for Goods and Services - enabling farmers to buy various goods and services from multiple sellers available across platform/applications, such as Agri Input, Tools and Machinery, Cattle Feed, Assaying, Farming as a Service, Equipment Renting etc
- F2B and F2G Seller Application - Allowing farmers to sell their produce in bulk to various stakeholders through multiple means such as
  -- Auction
  -- Procurement
  -- Reverse Auction
  Buyer can be either a business - trader/processor or govt.
  -- Pre Harvest & Harvest - to be bought by farmer independently
  -- Post Harvest (Produce related) - farmers can buy these services and bundle them with produce to give value added offering to buyers. Ex, A farmer can buy logistics and provide a delivery option to the buyer.
- B2C Seller Application - Sell processed/packaged products directly to consumers

As illustrated in the diagrams below, farmers and other buyers can use any buyer app on the network and seamlessly access all service providers through a network of sellers nationwide, each specialising in specific offerings. This will lead to a more efficient and integrated agricultural ecosystem.
