summary: Agricultural Equipment Hiring (Buyer extend the renting period)
description: >-
  The following is an illustrative flow to perform a transaction of a nature where a buyer would like to hire agricultural equipment. The booking majorly happens in four phases of order processing flow, i.e. Discovery of available services and service providers based on serviceability, order, fulfillment and post-fulfillment.
  If Buyer wants to extend the renting period (For e.g. He rented the equipment for 3 Hours and now wants to use it for next 2 Hours)
  We are enabling following ways to handle this via the protocol, Case 1: if given inventory is available to hire then
  either a new order will be create using Parent Child Order mapping Or Surcharge will be sent in the Price Quote in the Update Call.
  Case 2: If the inventory is not available then based on delivery mode selected, action will be taken so lets say if delivery mode selected for Delivery (Seller-fulfilled) then Seller may collect back the Equipment at the time of the completion 
  and if Self Pick Up (Buyer-fulfilled) then Seller may charge a Fee/Surcharge as per his terms and conditions.
