        non-living entity like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of agents are
        Doctor in the healthcare sector, a driver in the mobility sector, or a
        delivery person in the logistics sector. This object can be set at any
        stage of the order lifecycle. This can be set at the discovery stage
        when the BPP wants to provide details on the agent fulfilling the order,
        like in healthcare, where the doctor's name appears during search. This
        object can also used to search for a particular person that the customer
        wants fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this object gets instantiated
        after the order is confirmed, like in the case of on-demand taxis, where
        the driver is assigned after the user confirms the ride.

        conference link during a teleconsultation.

    Context:
      description: >-
        Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a high-level
        overview to the receiver about the nature of the intended transaction.
        Typically, it is the BAP that sets the transaction context based on the
        consumer's location and action on their UI. But sometimes, during
        unsolicited callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
        is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
        request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP. The context
        object contains four types of fields. <ol><li>Demographic information
        about the transaction using fields like `domain`, `country`, and
        `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and receiving
        platform's ID and API URL.</li><li>Interoperability information like the
        protocol version that implemented by the sender and,</li><li>Transaction

        transaction_id that represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a

        sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key
        to encrypt information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be
        passed in every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
        implementations, it is not necessary to send the context during the
        synchronous response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the context
        must be sent during all interactions,

        keeping in mind relevance, performance, and opportunity cost. It is

        the BPP reserves the right to decide the terms of payment. However, the
        BAP can send its terms to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to
        those terms, it must overwrite the terms and return them to the BAP. If
        overridden, the BAP must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP in
        order to preserve the provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
        case of such disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform offline
        negotiations on the payment terms. Once an agreement is reached, the BAP
        and BPP can resume transactions.

        filter search results. BPPs can use tags to index their catalog to allow
        better search functionality. Tags are sent by the BPP as part of the
        catalog response in the `on_search` callback. Tags are also meant for
        display purposes. Upon receiving a tag, BAPs are meant to render them as
        name-value pairs. This is particularly useful when rendering tabular
        information about a product or service.

    XInput:
      description: >-
        Contains any additional or extended inputs required to confirm an order.
        This is typically a Form Input. Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
        is not enough for the BPP to confirm an order. For example, to confirm a
        flight ticket, the airline requires details of the passengers along with
        information on baggage, identity, in addition to the class of ticket.
        Similarly, a logistics company may require details on the nature of
        shipment in order to confirm the shipping. A recruiting firm may require
        additional details on the applicant in order to confirm a job
        application. For all such purposes, the BPP can choose to send this
        object attached to any object in the catalog that is required to be sent
        while placing the order. This object can typically be sent at an item
        level or at the order level. The item level XInput will override the
        Order level XInput as it indicates a special requirement of information
        for that particular item. Hence the BAP must render a separate form for
        the Item and another form at the Order level before confirmation.

  - summary: B2C Retail Exports (Buyer Cancels Full Order)
    description: >-
      The following is an illustrative flow to perform a transaction of a nature
      where a buyer from outside India would like to buy an item. The buyer
      selects the items, builds the cart, makes the payment and confirms the
      order. However due to some reason, the buyer then cancels the order.
      Seller may charge fee as per the cancellation terms communicated to the
      buyer. Any refund applicable would be initiated to the buyer's account
      directly by the seller through OPGSP.

      items. The seller app receives the order request and checks the stock
      availability. Seller app provides a quotation, including details on
      pricing, shipping costs, and estimated delivery time. After order
      confirmation, seller app provides regular order updates like Pickup
      Approved, Order pickup up, Domestic custom cleared, At destination hub,
      Out for delivery, Order delivered, etc.The transaction is considered
      fulfilled when the buyer receives the items in satisfactory condition,

                    max_liability_cap is the maximum aggregate liability
                    expressed in Indian Rupees (INR). To illustrate, if the
                    value of max_liability is set to “2”, the total transaction
                    value is INR 100, and max_liability_cap is empty, that will
                    mean the aggregate liability of either party shall not be
                    more than INR 200 (i.e. 2 multiplied by 100). If the
                    max_liability_cap is set as 100, and the max_liability is
                    empty, that means the maximum aggregate liability will be
                    INR 100. If both, max_liability_cap and max_liability are
                    provided, then the maximum aggregate liability will be the
                    lower of the two amounts. To illustrate, if the
                    max_liability is set to “2”, the total transaction value is
                    INR 100, and the max_liability_cap is set to 100. That will
                    mean the maximum aggregate liability will be INR 100 (the
                    lower of INR 200 and INR 100). If neither max_liability_cap
                    nor max_liability are provided, i.e. both are empty, that
                    would mean the contract does not have any clause related to
                    limitation of liability. Effectively that would mean the
                    liability is uncapped. If max_liability_cap and
                    max_liability are both set to 0 (zero), that would mean that
                    both parties agree that neither of them will bear any
                    liability.

                    counterparty Network Participant, calculated pro rata for
                    each calendar day of delay. As an example, if the value is
                    set as “7.3”, and the amount of payment due is INR 1000,
                    that will mean the Payment Collector will pay the
                    counterparty Network Participant an interest of 7.3% per
                    annum (i.e. INR 100), calculated pro rata for each day of
                    delay. So if the Payment Collector delay was 50 days, the
                    total interest payable would be INR 10 [calculated as
